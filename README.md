### Approach and Design Choices

#### Backend:

1. **Express.js with MongoDB:**
   - Selected Express.js as the backend framework for its simplicity, flexibility, and robust ecosystem of middleware.
   - Integrated MongoDB as the database solution for its scalability, flexibility, and compatibility with JavaScript and Node.js.

2. **User Registration:**
   - Implemented a RESTful API endpoint (`api/v1/register`) to handle user registration, allowing users to create accounts by providing necessary information.
   - Utilized bcrypt, a proven hashing algorithm, to securely hash passwords before storing them in the database, ensuring the confidentiality of user credentials.
   - Implemented server-side data validation to enforce data integrity and prevent injection attacks, leveraging libraries like Joi or express-validator.

3. **User Login:**
   - Developed a login endpoint (`api/v1/login`) to authenticate users using their credentials (username/email and password).
   - Generated JSON Web Tokens (JWT) upon successful authentication, containing relevant user information (excluding sensitive data like passwords), to facilitate stateless authentication.
   - Integrated JWT authentication middleware to validate and decode tokens for protected routes, enhancing security and scalability.

4. **Session Management:**
   - Managed user sessions using cookies to authenticate subsequent requests, ensuring seamless navigation and user experience.
   - Implemented session persistence without relying on sticky sessions, enabling stateful communication between the client and server without compromising security.
   - Configured session settings (e.g., cookie expiration, secure flag) to optimize security and performance, adhering to industry best practices.

5. **Security Measures:**
   - Implemented robust security measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and injection attacks.
   - Sanitized user input to prevent vulnerabilities like XSS, leveraging libraries like DOMPurify or implementing custom sanitization middleware.
   - Employed security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, XSS Protection) to mitigate risks associated with XSS attacks and enhance overall application security.

### Implementation Details

1. **Express Server Setup:**
   - Configured an Express server with essential middleware (e.g., body-parser, cors) to handle HTTP requests and responses.
   - Integrated session management middleware (e.g., express-session) to manage user sessions and cookies securely.
   - Established routes for user registration, login, logout, and protected routes, adhering to RESTful principles for consistent and predictable API design.

2. **User Authentication:**
   - Implemented robust authentication mechanisms, including password hashing with bcrypt, to safeguard user credentials and protect against unauthorized access.
   - Utilized JWT tokens for stateless authentication, reducing server-side storage and enhancing scalability.
   - Integrated middleware to validate JWT tokens and authenticate users for protected routes, ensuring secure access control and preventing unauthorized access.

3. **Session Management:**
   - Managed user sessions securely using cookies and session tokens, enabling seamless authentication and authorization across multiple requests.
   - Configured session settings (e.g., cookie attributes, session storage options) to optimize security, performance, and user experience.
   - Implemented session persistence mechanisms to maintain user sessions across server restarts and sessions expiration, ensuring uninterrupted access for authenticated users.

4. **Security Measures:**
   - Implemented input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks and protect against common vulnerabilities like XSS.
   - Integrated security headers and middleware to enforce strict security policies and mitigate risks associated with XSS attacks, injection attacks, and other security threats.
   - Regularly updated dependencies and libraries to patch security vulnerabilities and ensure the application's resilience against emerging threats.
